# The living-room

This 3D model was realized for the purpose of my portfolio ( www.emiliegauvin.com/projects ). 
It was built and texturized in Blender and sunrays and movement effects were added in Three.js with custom shader materials. 
Move your cursor around to move the camera inside the model.
Built in Three.js and Blender
