# The living-room

This 3D model was realized for the purpose of my portfolio ( www.emiliegauvin.com/projects ). 
It was built and texturized in Blender and light and movement effects were added in Three.js with custom shaders. 
Move your cursor around to move the camera inside the model.
Built in Three.js and Blender
